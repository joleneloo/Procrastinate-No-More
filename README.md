# Procrastinate-No-More
(Naming credits to my very creative sister)

Looking for some incentive to complete the tasks on your to-do list?
Wishing you get to reward yourself for getting things done?

Look no further! 

I present to you Procrastinate-No-More, the To-Do List program that rewards you for completing your jobs!

Originally called 'The Organiser', this project was created over a few weeks together with a classmate for our first year Object Oriented Programming class. While I worked on the main interface of the program, she created the rewards system which is what makes our program different to other To-Do List programs out there.

- To use the program, download all the files into a folder and type "make main" in the command line.

IMPORTANT: The program does not currently save to-do lists when you exit the program, so DO NOT use it as your real to-do list. We intended to implement code that saves the to-do list when exiting the program but did not get to coding that part by the time we had to submit the project. I intend to add that at some point when I get a chance. :)

Thank you for checking out my project!
